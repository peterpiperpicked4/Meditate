Did a 13-minute meditation by the river this morning. I was really able to look inward and talk to my younger self, and I felt very proud of that ability to focus and do that.

I'm not always sure that what I'm doing is working, but I know that if I'm focused, calm, doing my breathing, and speaking to my younger self, then I'm doing some really good work no matter what.

It was a really foggy, cold-to-the-bone morning at 33°F - the kind where the chill seeps right through you. But there's something about meditating in that raw, quiet stillness.
